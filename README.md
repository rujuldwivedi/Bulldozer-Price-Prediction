In this notebook, we're going to go through an example machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers.

Since we're trying to predict a number, this kind of problem is known as a **regression problem**.

The data and evaluation metric we'll be using (root mean square log error or RMSLE) is from the [Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview).

The techniques used in here have been inspired and adapted from [the fast.ai machine learning course](https://course18.fast.ai/ml).

## What we'll end up with

Since we already have a dataset, we'll approach the problem with the following machine learning modelling framework.

| 6 Step Machine Learning Modelling Framework ([read more](https://whimsical.com/9g65jgoRYTxMXxDosndYTB)) |

To work through these topics, we'll use pandas, Matplotlib and NumPy for data anaylsis, as well as, Scikit-Learn for machine learning and modelling tasks.

We'll work through each step and by the end of the notebook, we'll have a trained machine learning model which predicts the sale price of a bulldozer given different characteristics about it.
